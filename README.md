# My Personal Project

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  

## What will the application do?
The application will allow user to log their workouts and diet.
In their logs they can keep track of what type of workout they did, for how long, and
how many calories they burned. In terms of nutrition they can keep track of their caloric intake, as well
as protein, fats, carbohydrates. All this over the course of a week.

## Who will use it?
Anyone looking to track their fitness progress and/or diet.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
I enjoy working out but keeping track of how healthy or unhealthy I've been
eating has always been difficult. Also, with these logs you can plan for 
workouts/meals ahead of schedule which is something that helps me keep things on the right
track and stay motivated.

Reflection: If i have more time to work on the project, I would...

- Refactor the Log class, because there are repetitive for loops
- Add exception classes that are thrown for negative values to make "Week" and "Food" more robust classes
- Refactor some methods with adding and deleting objects to a log, because there is heavy repetition in the structure
